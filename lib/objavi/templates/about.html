      <h1>Objavi: the Booktype publishing system</h1>

      <p>
        Booktype books are written and stored as HTML, but are
        converted to PDF and other formats for printing, reading, or
        further processing.  Programs which perform this task are
        called objavi (pronounced "ob-YAH-vee", as if the J was a Y),
        after the Croatian word "objavi!" meaning "publish!".
      </p>
