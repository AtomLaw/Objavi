Installing Objavi	
-----------------


0. Fetch the tarball or clone the git repositiory with

   git clone git://github.com/sourcefabric/Objavi.git

This has probably already been done because that's how you found this file.


1. Install dependencies.

- lxml
- pdftk
- pdfedit
- pdflatex
- xvfb
- fontconfig
- ttf-???     -- you'll need some fonts
- psutils
- poppler-utils or xpdf-utils
- httpd       -- apache2 is easiest because a config file is included
- wkhtmltopdf -- version 0.11.0_rc1 or newer, download from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/

To make ODF documents, you need a whole lot of OpenOffice 3 or LibreOffice 3.
The following packages and their dependencies might be sufficient, though
you might also need to install a Java runtime:

- openoffice.org-common
- openoffice.org-core
- openoffice.org-filter-binfilter
- openoffice.org-gcj
- openoffice.org-writer
- python-uno


2. Make sure the following files are executable (and no others):

- cgi-bin/*.cgi
- cgi-bin/font-list.cgi.pdf
- bin/html2odt
- bin/pdfnup


3. Make sure the following directories exist and are writable by
   the www-data group (or whoever is your webserver user):

- data/books
- data/booki-books
- data/shared
- data/tmp
- cache
- logs

The "setup.sh" file shows a way of doing this.


4. Configure your webserver.  For Apache 2 you can use the following steps:

  4.1. Copy example site configuration file doc/deployment/example-apache.conf
       to /etc/apache2/sites-available/objavi

  4.2. Copy example WSGI configuration script doc/deployment/example-objavi.wsgi
       to objavi.wsgi

  4.3. Copy example Django configuration module doc/deployment/example-settings.py
       to settings.py

  4.4. Edit the site configuration file, the WSGI configuration script and the
       Django configuration module, replacing each occurrence of "/var/www/objavi/"
       with the location of your Objavi installation.
       Adjust other parameters as you see fit.

  4.5. Execute the following command as super-user:

       a2ensite objavi

  4.5. Restart or reload the webserver.
