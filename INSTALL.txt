Installing Objavi
=================

This document describes how to install the Objavi service on a host running
some version of the Linux operating system.

Installation of Objavi is split into three steps: installing prerequisites,
getting the Objavi source code and creating an Objavi site.


Prerequisites
-------------

Objavi depends on a number of external tools and libraries for it's operation.
Package names might vary depending on the operating system you are using.

  - lxml

    $ sudo apt-get install python-lxml

  - psutils

    $ sudo apt-get install psutils

  - poppler-utils

    $ sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

  - pdftk

    $ sudo apt-get install pdftk

  - pdfedit

    $ sudo apt-get install pdfedit

  - pdflatex

    $ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base

  - Fontconfig

    $ sudo apt-get install fontconfig

  - Xvfb

    $ sudo apt-get install xvfb

  - Calibre, version 0.8.38 or newer

    $ sudo apt-get install calibre

  - Python-UNO bridge

    $ sudo apt-get install python-uno

  - wkhtmltopdf, version 0.11.0_rc1, from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/

    $ wget http://wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com/files/wkhtmltopdf-0.11.0_rc1-static-i386.tar.bz2
    $ bunzip2 -c wkhtmltopdf-0.11.0_rc1-static-i386.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
    $ mv wkhtmltopdf-i386 /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

  - Apache2 with mod_wsgi

    $ sudo apt-get install apache2
    $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

  - Django

    $ sudo apt-get install python-django

To create ODF output, you also need a whole lot of OpenOffice or LibreOffice 3.


Getting Objavi
--------------

If you are reading this file chances are that you already have a copy of the
Objavi source code.  If that is not the case the easiest way to obtain one is
to clone the official Objavi git repository:

  git clone git://github.com/sourcefabric/Objavi.git

After unpacking the sources go to the Objavi's top-level directory and make
sure that the following files are executable:

  bin/*
  cgi-bin/*.cgi
  cgi-bin/font-list.cgi.pdf

Objavi also requires some sources from its sister project Booktype.  If you
don't already have Booktype sources on the system get them from the same place
you got Objavi from:

  git clone git://github.com/sourcefabric/Booktype.git


Creating a Site
---------------

Once you have everything in place you are ready to create an Objavi site.

The 'create_site' script located in the 'scripts' directory of the Objavi
source tree does exactly that.  The script requires a destination directory
where the site will be created.

The following command creates an Objavi installation inside /var/www/objavi:

  ./scripts/create_site /var/www/objavi

Make sure you have the write permissions for the destination directory.

If you don't have Booktype installed globally on the system (i.e. somewhere
in the PYTHONPATH) you will have to specify the path to Booktype's source
directory when running the script, e.g.:

  ./scripts/create_site --with-booktype=/usr/local/src/Booktype /var/www/objavi

If the site was successfully created the script will notify you that a file
named 'POST_INSTALL.txt' has been created there and that you should read it.
To complete the installation simply follow the instructions found in the
'POST_INSTALL.txt' file.
