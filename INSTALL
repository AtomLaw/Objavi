Installing Objavi2 on a Debian machine.


0. Fetch the tarball or clone the git repositiory with

   git clone git://repo.or.cz/objavi2.git

(hint: this has probably already been done because that's how you
found this file).


1. Install dependencies.  Everything is apt-gettable in Debian Lenny
   except wkhtml2pdf, which is available in Squeeze (testing), and
   openoffice 3, which is in Squeeze and in lenny-backports.

lxml
pdfedit          (4.1+)
xvfb             (unnecessary if you're just testing under another X server)
fontconfig
ttf-???          (you'll need some fonts)
pdftk
psutils
pdfedit
poppler-utils or xpdf-utils
httpd            (apache2 is easiest because a config file is included)

wkhtmltopdf     (download from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ - you
                 can choose whether to compile or use the existing binary)

To make ODF documents, you need a whole lot of openoffice 3.  The
following packages and their dependencies might be sufficient, though
you might also need to install a java runtime.

openoffice.org-common     (1:3 +)
openoffice.org-core
openoffice.org-filter-binfilter
openoffice.org-gcj        (not certain about this)
openoffice.org-writer
python-uno


2. Make sure the following three files are executable (and no others):

htdocs/*.cgi
htdocs/font-list.cgi.pdf
bin/html2odt


3. Make sure the following directories exist and are writable by
   www-data (or whoever is your webserver user):

books
cache
tmp

The file ./setup.sh shows a way of doing this.


4. Configure your webserver.  For apache 2.2 you can use the following steps:

  4.1 edit the file apache-config-objavi2 and replace each occurrence
      of '/home/douglas/objavi2' with the name of your objavi
      directory.  Adjust other parameters as you see fit.

  4.2 Copy apache-config-objavi2 to /etc/apache2/sites-available/objavi2

  4.3 sudo a2ensite objavi2

  4.4 Turn off http compression (mod_deflate, etc) for objavi.py -- it
      breaks the progress reporting.  (Apologies for this).

5. Restart or reload the webserver.
