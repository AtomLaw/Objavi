Installing Objavi2 on a Debian machine.


0. Fetch the tarball or clone the git repositiory with

   git clone git://repo.or.cz/objavi2.git

(hint: this has probably already been done because that's how you
found this file).


1. Install dependencies.  Everything is apt-gettable in Debian Lenny or testing.

lxml
pdfedit          (4.1+)
xvfb             (unnecessary if you're just testing under another X server)
fontconfig
ttf-???          (you'll need some fonts)
pdftk
pdfedit
poppler-utils or xpdf-utils
a httpd          (apache2 is easiest because a config file is included)


2. Make sure the following two files are executable (and no others):

./objavi2.py
./font-list.cgi.pdf


3. Make sure the following directories exist and are writable by
   www-data (or whoever is you webserver user):

books
cache
tmp

The file ./setup.sh shows a way of doing this.


4. Configure your webserver.  For apache 2.2 you can use the following steps:

  4.1 edit the file apache-config-objavi2 and replace each occurrence
      of '/home/douglas/objavi2' with the name of your objavi
      directory.  Adjust other parameters as you see fit.
 
  4.2 Copy apache-config-objavi2 to /etc/apache2/sites-available/objavi2
  
  4.3 sudo a2ensite objavi2 


5. Restart or reload the webserver.
